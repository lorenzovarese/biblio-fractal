# README for `db_single_author_generator` Script

## Script Name
`db_single_author_generator.py`

## Description
This Python script generates a new XML file containing all entries where a specified name appears as an `<author>` from a given DBLP database XML file. The script performs a search on the existing database and writes a new XML file containing only those entries relevant to the given author.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `lxml` library
- `argparse` library
- `os` and `sys` libraries
- `tqdm` library for progress bar display

## Usage
Run the script from the terminal as follows:

```
python db_single_author_generator.py [author_name]
```

- `author_name`: The name of the author for which you want to generate a new database.

## Functions

### `generate_author_db(file_path, author_name, output_file_path)`

#### Parameters
- `file_path` (str): The path to the DBLP XML database file.
- `author_name` (str): The name of the author for whom the new XML database will be generated.
- `output_file_path` (str): The path to the output XML file.

#### Description
This function iterates through the provided XML file, searching for entries where the specified author name appears as an `<author>`. It then adds those entries to a new XML file. A comment is added at the top of the output file to specify what the script does.

#### Return
None. The function writes the new XML database to an output file and prints the total count of elements found for the specified author.

## Output Examples
- Output in Terminal:
  ```
  Total count of elements found for author [author_name]: [count] (please verify if it matches the website)
  The count of elements attributed to '[author_name]' as <author> in the output XML file might be lower.
  ```

## Note
- The script includes an XML comment at the top of the output file to indicate what entries the new database contains.
- The script performs iterative parsing and clears each element after processing to minimize memory usage. Therefore, ensure your system has adequate resources to handle large XML files.
- The script uses a progress bar to indicate how much of the file has been processed.
